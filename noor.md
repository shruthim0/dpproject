## Noor
> Prepare to follow in the footsteps of some of the most famous, *and* infamous, sailors of the West Indies. Both prince and pirate have set foot on this very island, and you'll get to learn all about it!
<br>
<br>
During the Golden Age of Piracy (1650s-1730s), privateers-turned-pirate needed remote and uncharted islands to stash the cargo they had looted from royal ships. France, Britain, and Spain were heavily robbed, but not for gold, like you might have thought. The most precious booty for pirates was sugar and rum; both could fetch a fair price, worth more than enough of their weight in gold.
