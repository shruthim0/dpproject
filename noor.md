### Sweet Cargo

During the Golden Age of Piracy (1650s-1730s), privateers-turned-pirate needed remote and uncharted islands to stash the cargo they had looted from royal ships. France, Britain, and Spain were heavily robbed, but not for gold, like you might have thought. The most precious loot for pirates was sugar and rum; both could fetch a fair price, worth more than enough of their weight in gold.

### The REAL Prize
